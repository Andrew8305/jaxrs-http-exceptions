# jaxrs-http-exceptions
The goal of this project is to make JAX-RS REST service errors follow HTTP specification guidances, make understanding and troubleshooting REST errors easy for both the client and server side, and to eliminate security concerns caused by exception/stack traces being dumped to the client.
